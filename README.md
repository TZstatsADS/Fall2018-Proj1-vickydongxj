This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: Does Age Affect Happiness? Are There Gender Differences in the Effect?
+ This project is conducted by Xiaojing Dong

+ Project summary: In this project, we explore whether the sources of happiness change with age and whether the gender has an impact on it. Text mining and natural language processing techniques were applied on "a corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments". The results suggests that the sources of happiness do change at different life stages with certain gender differences.
